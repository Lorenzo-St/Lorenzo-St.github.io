            Simply Survive is a game that I made on my own during the first year
            of college. It was a simple project made initially entirely in C. It
            is a 2D top down wave based shooter, where you must survive for as
            long as possible against increasingly more difficult waves of
            enemies.
          </p>
          <p>
            I rewrote the entire project in C++ when I was preparing to launch
            it on steam. The project makes use of Cprocessing as it's main
            engine backend. When rewriting the project, I made it so that all
            items are serialized and easily modified.

            Arcanic Cards was a team game that I worked on in my GAM100 class in
            college. It was a simple card game where the core gimic was that you
            could buy new cards in the middle of a match.
          </p>
          <p>
            The game only consisted of a tutorial and a vs AI game mode. I was
            the one who built the entire card handling back end and the
            tutorial.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was also responsible for writing the AI that the player plays
            against

            This game was made as my GAM 150 team game in my second semster of
            Digipen. It is a top-down rouge-lite
            <span style="font-style: italic">horror</span> game where you play
            as a robot who is the last un-corrupted robot in a network that has
            been corrupted by an eldritch creature.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your goal is to evade all the other corrupted robots in an attempt
            to reach reach and deactivate several terminals across each level.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was responsible for developing the graphics backend and the basic
            engine framework which includes the entity factory, component base
            structure, and engine base structure.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was also responsible for the physics implementation. This
            consisted of simple tile map collisions and AABB collisions.
